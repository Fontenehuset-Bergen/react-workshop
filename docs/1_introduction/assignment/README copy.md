# Week 1: Assignments
Here are the assignments for an introduction to React, I have intentionally chosen that the assignments should not be necessary to solve in React since there is still a lot you have not learned yet. Instead, I have created several .ts files that I want you to fill in. Once you have filled in the files, you can commit the changes to your own branch. This working method will be unique for this week, from now on we will do all tasks in the React page instead :)

As part of the immersion you have already downloaded this repo locally or you are using stackblitz, now I want you to try to implement the solutions in the `src/pages/Home.tsx` file so that you can see your result on the website.
